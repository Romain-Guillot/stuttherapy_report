\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Before I begin, I would like to thank all the people who contributed to the smooth running of my internship by help me financially, morally or for being here with me.

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor at the host university, \textbf{Dr. Noreen Izza Arshad}, and her entire team for their hospitality in the laboratory and for their advices on living in Malaysia.

I also thank \textbf{Jean François Monin} for agreeing to be my teacher-referee and for being here if needed during these 12 weeks.

I would also like to thank \textbf{the french Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region} for having helped me financially thanks to the \textit{Explo'ra} scholarship, without which this trip more than $10,000$km from my home would have required a lot of sacrifices. I also thank \textbf{my parents} who paid for all the extra costs, and for their moral support.

Finally, I would like to thank \textbf{Thibaut Arnoux}, \textbf{Maxime Lordey} and \textbf{Oussama Belkacemi}, friends and students of Polytech Grenoble for these 3 months of collocations and good mood. I would like to thank even more warmly Oussama Belkacemi, better known as \textit{Little Oussama}, for letting my credit card be destroyed by a cash machine allowing me to order a new credit card.
