These twelve weeks of internship were very rewarding from a professional and personal point of view.

The proposed subject made it possible to discover how to work on all the stages of project development, from the idea to the production on the market. I was able to consolidate many of the knowledge I acquired during my engineering studies. I also acquired a lot of crucial knowledge for an apprentice engineer, such as time management during the project or the stages of production implementation, to take just two examples.

On a more personal level, a 3-month experience abroad with 3 friends can only be enriching! I was able to discover a new culture both in everyday life and in professional life.
